Welcome to another Bite-Sized tutorial! Today, we’ll walk you through installing **Git**, the essential tool for managing your code and collaborating with others.

### Step 1: Downloading and Installing Git

1. Open your browser and visit the official Git website: [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com).  
2. Click the big **Download** button on the homepage. The website should automatically detect your operating system.  
3. For **Windows** users:  
   - Run the downloaded installer.  
   - During installation, mostly accept the default options.  
   - Make sure to keep **“Git from the command line and also from 3rd-party software”** selected.  
4. For **Mac** users:  
   - You can download the installer from the site or  
   - Install via Homebrew by running in the terminal:  

   ```bash
   brew install git
   ```

5. For **Linux** users (Ubuntu example):  
   Open a terminal and type:  

   ```bash
    sudo apt update && sudo apt install git
   ```

### Step 2: Verify Git Installation in VSCode Terminal

1. Open your terminal inside VSCode by pressing:  
   - **Ctrl + `** (Windows/Linux) or  
   - **Cmd + `** (Mac)  
2. Type the following command:  

   ```bash
    git --version
   ```

3. If Git is installed correctly, you’ll see the Git version number printed.  
4. If you get an error, double-check your installation or try restarting your terminal/computer.

### Step 3: (Optional) Set up Your Git Identity

If this is your first time using Git, configure your user name and email. This information will appear in your commit history.

Run these commands in the terminal (replace with your details):

<pre><code class="language-bash">
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your@email.com"
</code></pre>
