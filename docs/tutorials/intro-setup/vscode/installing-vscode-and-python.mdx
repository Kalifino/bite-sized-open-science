Welcome back to **Bite-Sized**! In this tutorial, we’ll guide you step-by-step through installing **Visual Studio Code (VSCode)** and **Python** on your computer. We’ll finish by running a simple “Hello, World!” program to confirm everything works perfectly.

### Step 1: Installing VSCode

1. Go to the official website: [code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com/).  
2. The site should detect your operating system automatically. Click the download button to get the installer.  
3. Run the installer:  
   - **Windows users:** Make sure to **check “Add to PATH”** during installation. This allows you to run VSCode commands from the terminal easily.  
4. Once installed, launch VSCode and get ready for coding!

:::tip
You can customize VSCode with themes and extensions to match your workflow. We'll cover recommended extensions in upcoming videos.

### Step 2: Installing Python

1. Visit [python.org/downloads](https://python.org/downloads) to download the latest stable version of Python for your OS.  
2. Run the Python installer:  
   - **Important:** Check the box **“Add Python to PATH”** before clicking **Install Now**. This lets you run Python commands from your terminal or command prompt.  
3. After installation, open your terminal (Command Prompt on Windows, Terminal on Mac/Linux) and type:  
   ```bash
   python --version
   ```
   This should display the installed Python version, confirming the setup was successful.

### Step 3: Testing Python in VSCode

1. Open VSCode.  
2. Click on the **Extensions** icon on the sidebar (looks like four squares) and search for **“Python”** by Microsoft. Install this extension — it adds Python support and debugging tools.  
3. Create a new file in VSCode, save it as `hello.py`.  
4. In the file, type the classic first program:  

    ```python
    print("Hello, World!")
    ```

5. Run your program by clicking the **play button** in the upper right corner or right-click the editor and select **Run Python File in Terminal**.  
6. If you see `Hello, World!` printed in the terminal, congratulations — your setup works!

:::tip
In the lower right corner of VSCode, you’ll see which Python interpreter is active — useful if you have multiple Python versions installed.

If commands like `python` or `code` don’t work in your terminal, double-check that you selected **Add to PATH** during installation.

### What’s Next?

Next up, we’ll install **Git** — the tool that powers GitHub — and introduce **virtual environments** to help manage your Python project dependencies.

Thanks for watching and happy coding!
