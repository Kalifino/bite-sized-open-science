Welcome to another Bite-Sized tutorial! Today, we’ll walk you through how to use **Git and GitHub directly inside VSCode**.

---

### Cloning a Repo in VSCode

1. Head over to your GitHub repository in your browser.  
2. Click the green **Code** button, make sure **HTTPS** is selected, and copy the URL. It should look like:

    ```
    https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
    ```

3. Open VSCode and press **Ctrl+Shift+P** (or **Cmd+Shift+P** on Mac) to open the Command Palette.  
4. Type:

    ```
    Git: Clone
    ```

5. Paste your repository URL, choose a local folder, and click **Open** when prompted.  
6. VSCode will clone the repo, download its data to your local folder, then reload with your new project ready to go.

### Activating or Creating a Virtual Environment

If the project already has a virtual environment folder (usually called `env` or `venv`), activate it by opening the terminal (**Ctrl + `**) and typing:

- On **Windows**:

    ```
    .\env\Scripts\activate
    ```

- On **macOS/Linux**:

    ```
    source env/bin/activate
    ```

If there’s no virtual environment yet, create one with:

    ```
    python -m venv env
    ```

Then activate it using the same commands above for your system.

*Tip:* Once activated, you’ll see the environment’s name in your terminal prompt. If VSCode asks you to select the Python interpreter, pick the one inside your `env` folder.

### Making a Change

Let’s make a small edit, for example, update the `README` file. After saving, VSCode will detect your change.

---

### Committing the Change

1. Open the **Source Control** tab on the left or press **Ctrl+Shift+G**.  
2. You’ll see your changed file listed.  
3. Write a commit message like:

    ```
    Update README
    ```

4. Click the checkmark icon above to commit.

---

### Pushing to GitHub

To push your commit, click **Sync Changes** either in the Source Control tab or the status bar. The first time you might be asked to sign into GitHub—just follow the prompts.

VSCode handles the rest!

### What’s Next?

You just cloned a repo, set up your environment, made a change, and pushed it—all from VSCode!

This is a workflow you’ll use repeatedly to keep your projects tidy and efficient.
