Welcome to this episode of **Bite-Sized**! In this tutorial, we’ll walk you through **how to create your very own GitHub account** — the essential first step for collaborating on code and managing your projects online. Plus, if you’re a student, we’ll explain how to sign up for **GitHub Education** to unlock powerful developer tools for free!

### Step 1: Creating Your GitHub Account

1. Go to [github.com/signup](https://github.com/signup) and enter your **email address** — make sure it’s one you check regularly!  
2. Choose a **username** carefully. This is your public identity on GitHub, so pick something professional and easy to remember.  
3. Create a **strong password** and confirm it. We recommend using a password manager to keep your credentials safe.  
4. Complete the **verification puzzle** to prove you’re not a bot.  
5. Click **“Create Account”**. GitHub may send a confirmation email — don’t forget to check your inbox and verify your email address.

> **Tip:**  
> Your GitHub username will appear on your profile, repositories, and contributions. If you plan to use GitHub professionally, consider keeping it simple and consistent with your other social media or professional handles.

### Step 2: Unlocking GitHub Education Benefits (For Students)

If you’re a student, you can access **free professional developer tools** through [GitHub Education](https://education.github.com/):

- Free access to popular software development tools.  
- Use **GitHub Copilot**, an AI-powered assistant that helps you write code faster and with fewer errors (stay tuned for our future video on Copilot!).  
- Access to exclusive learning resources and discounts.

**How to apply:**  
1. Visit [education.github.com](https://education.github.com/).  
2. Click **“Join GitHub Education”** and follow the steps to verify your student status with your school email or student ID.  
3. Enable **two-factor authentication (2FA)** — this is required for Education benefits and also greatly improves your account security.

> **Security Tip:**  
> Two-factor authentication adds an extra layer of protection by requiring a second step to verify your identity, usually a code from your phone. It’s highly recommended even if you’re not applying for Education benefits.
