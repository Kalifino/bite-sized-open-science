Welcome to another **Bite-Sized** tutorial! This video covers the essentials of **GitHub Commits and Pull Requests** — two core tools for managing and collaborating on code.

Commits are snapshots of your project’s state—save your work often with clear messages.

:::tip[Pull Requests]

Pull requests let you propose, discuss, and merge changes from one branch into another.

**GitHub Commits and Pull Requests – Key Takeaways**

- **What is a Commit?**  
  A commit saves your changes to the project with a message explaining what you did. It’s like a save point in your work history.

- **Creating Commits:**  
  - Edit your files and click **“Commit changes”**.  
  - Write a clear commit message and optionally add a description.

- **Viewing Commit History:**  
  - Head to the **“Commits”** tab to see all past snapshots, who made them, and when.

- **What is a Pull Request?**  
  - A way to propose merging changes from your branch into the main branch.  
  - Team members can review, comment, and approve before merging.

- **Creating and Merging Pull Requests:**  
  1. Click **“Contribute” → “Open Pull Request”**.  
  2. Select the source (feature) and target (main) branches.  
  3. Add a title and description explaining your changes.  
  4. After approval, click **“Merge pull request”** and confirm.  
  5. Delete the feature branch when done.
