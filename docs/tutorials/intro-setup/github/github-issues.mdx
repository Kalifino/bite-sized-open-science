Welcome back to **Bite-Sized**! In this episode, Fabian and Timnah introduce you to **GitHub Issues**, a core feature for tracking tasks, reporting problems, and discussing ideas directly within a GitHub repository.

:::tip[Why Use Issues?]

Issues help you keep work visible and organized.
They make tasks, questions, and decisions transparent for everyone involved in a project.

:::

:::danger[Effective Issue Management]

Unclear or outdated issues can quickly pile up.
Write focused issues and close them once they're resolved!

### What is an Issue?

A GitHub Issue is a **discussion thread** associated with a repository. Issues can be used to:
- Report bugs or problems
- Propose new features or improvements
- Track to-do items and project tasks
- Ask questions or start discussions
- Document decisions and project progress

Each issue has a title, a description written in Markdown, and a unique number.
Issues remain part of the repository’s history, making them well suited for open and collaborative work.

### When to Use Issues:

- Report bugs or unexpected behavior.  
- Suggest new features or improvements. 
- Track to-do items and project tasks. 
- Ask questions or start discussions.
- Document decisions and project progress.

---

### Creating a New Issue

1. Navigate to the **Issues** tab of the repository.  
2. Click **“New issue”**.
3. Add a clear, concise title.
4. Describe the problem, task, or idea in the issue body.
    - Explain the context.
    - Describe what needs to be done or discussed.
    - Add links, code snippets, or references if helpful. 
5. Submit the issue.

### Managing Issues 

- Use **labels** to categorize issues (e.g., bug, enhancement, question).  
- Assign issues to team members responsible for addressing them using **assignees**.  
- Use **milestones** to group related issues for larger projects or releases.

---

### Discussing and Closing Issues

Issues are designed for discussion:
- Team members can comment on issues to discuss details, ask questions, or provide updates.
- You can reference issues in commits and pull requests by using `#issue_number`.
- Once an issue is resolved, it should be closed to indicate completion.

---

### Best Practices for Issues

- Write issues from the perspective of someone unfamiliar with the project.
- Use templates for common issue types (e.g. bug reports or task descriptions).  
- Break down large tasks into smaller, manageable issues.
- Link issues to related pull requests for better traceability.  
- Close issues when they are resolved to keep the issue tracker clean.

### What's Next?

GitHub Issues integrate closely with pull requests.
In the next Bite-Sized video, you’ll learn how to link issues to code changes and automatically close them when work is completed.

Thanks for watching and happy collaborating!
