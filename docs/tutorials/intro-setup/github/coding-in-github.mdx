Welcome to this episode of **Bite-Sized**! Today, we’ll explain why **Visual Studio Code (VSCode)** is our preferred tool over editing code directly on GitHub. We’ll also introduce what VSCode is and why it can make coding much easier and more efficient.

### What is VSCode?

**Visual Studio Code (VSCode)** is a free, open-source code editor developed by Microsoft. It supports many programming languages like Python, JavaScript, C++, and more.

Key features include:  
- **Auto-completion & Syntax Highlighting:** Helps you write code faster and spot errors quickly.  
- **Error Checking:** Real-time linting alerts you to mistakes as you type.  
- **Built-in Git Integration:** Manage your repositories directly from the editor.  
- **Extensions:** Customize VSCode with thousands of plugins, like debuggers, linters, themes, and AI coding assistants such as GitHub Copilot.

### Why Not Just Code on GitHub?

GitHub’s built-in web editor lets you make quick changes, but it has significant limitations:

- You can only edit **one file at a time** — no multi-file editing or project-wide search.  
- It lacks coding tools like **auto-complete**, **syntax highlighting**, and **error detection**.  
- There’s no way to **build, test, or debug** your code before committing, which increases the chance of errors in your repository.

VSCode, on the other hand, runs locally on your computer and allows you to:  
- **Edit multiple files and folders** seamlessly.  
- Use advanced coding tools and extensions to boost productivity.  
- **Test and debug** your code before pushing changes to GitHub, ensuring higher code quality and fewer mistakes.

Plus, VSCode’s integration with GitHub means you can still **commit, push, pull, and manage branches** without leaving the editor.
