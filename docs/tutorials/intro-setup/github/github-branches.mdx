Welcome back to **Bite-Sized**! In this episode, Timnah and Fabian introduce you to **GitHub Branches** — a powerful way to work on new ideas without affecting your main project.

:::tip[Why Branches?]

Branches let you experiment safely.  
Try new features or fixes without changing the main code until you’re ready.

:::danger[Branch Management]

Don’t leave stale branches lying around — delete them once you’re done to keep your repo clean!

**GitHub Branches – Key Takeaways**

- **What is a Branch?**  
  A branch is a parallel version of your project where you can work independently from the main branch.

- **Branch Usage:**  
  - Start a branch to add features, fix bugs, or test changes.  
  - Changes on one branch don’t affect others until merged.

- **Creating and Switching Branches:**  
  1. Open the **branches menu** on GitHub and click **“New branch”**.  
  2. Name your branch and switch to it.  
  3. Switch back anytime via the same menu.

- **Deleting Branches:**  
  - Open the branches menu and click the **trash bin icon** next to the branch you want to remove.

> **Next Steps:** Once comfortable with branches, learn how to merge changes back into your main branch using pull requests in our next video!
