**GitHub Repositories – Key Takeaways**

- **What is GitHub?**  
  A web platform for hosting, sharing, and collaborating on code projects—think Google Drive for developers, with built-in version control.

- **Repository Basics:**  
  - A **repo** (repository) is a folder that holds all your project’s files, commit history, and notes.  
  - You can view every past version, track who made each change, and roll back if needed.

- **Visibility & Collaboration:**  
  - **Private repos** restrict access to invited collaborators only.  
  - **Public repos** let anyone view and contribute.  

- **Creating a Repo in Seconds:**  
  1. On GitHub's homepage, click  **“+” → “New repository”**. 
  2. Enter a name and description, choose public or private, then create.  
  3. Invite teammates by searching their usernames.

- **Exploring Commit History:**  
  - Click **“Commits”** to see a list of changes.  
  - Select any commit to inspect file-by-file diffs and authorship.
